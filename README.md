# CS504
Repository for CS504 Project - Salary Predictor Model Using Census Data

This project tried to develop a model to accurately predict the salary of a person using different predictor variables. Data from the ASEC Census Dataset from 2019 and 2020 was used and analyzed during this project. A variety of algorithms (Correlation, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting) were used to model and analyze the data using R, Python, Tableau, and AWS SageMaker

The project is organized in 3 folders:
Data : contains the csv files of 2 datasets (with and without outliers) containing 41 columns and over 338K rows, and a data dictionary for the different category codes that were used to describe the variables  

Code: it consists of the actual R, Python, and Tableau files developed during the project. RStudio and a Anaconda Jupyter Notebook were used to develop the code.

Report: final report document containing all the analyses and findings
